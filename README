The UR5 robot is an industrial robot easy to use. 

In this project I use the robotic toolbox by Peter Corck to simulate its behaviour.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Main optimizzation

1) Collision detection -> Collision between object and link
                          Collision between object and joint
                          Collision between object and EE

2) Singularities Avoidance Trajectory

For change the main object structure change the file called train structure.
The object is build by the pHRIWARE.
